    <h2>WEEKLY REVIEW</h2>
    <p>This week, I was busy with Git branches. I was left with one challenge to complete: figuring out how to add the Git tag.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, I had a session with Warrick, during which he assisted me in resolving the challenge I had with the Git tag. Additionally, I completed the work that Warrick assigned to me. I was occupied with an English task, focusing on learning about adjectives. I found the topic challenging, particularly understanding comparatives and superlatives. However, I conducted research to gain a better understanding of adjectives.</p>
<p>  
    Thursday and Friday, I was occupied with the command line. I conducted research on YouTube to learn more about it. During my exploration, I gained insights into creating and modifying files and directories, as well as copying and moving files.</p>
